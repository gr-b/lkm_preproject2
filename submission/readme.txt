Notes:
The assignment says to use the file "syscall_table_32.S"
and the file "unistd_32.h" while neither of these files
exist. Later on, the assigment uses "syscall_32.tbl" and
"syscalls.h" instead of the previous files, so I assumed 
that these should be used instead. 
These files are included in the submission instead of 
the other ones (I assume this is the way it should be).

The testcalls.c file is simply the proj2test.c file
from the course website with the name changed.
